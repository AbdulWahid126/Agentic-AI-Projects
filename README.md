# Agentic-AI Projects 🚀

This repository contains all of my hands-on projects and assignments related to **Agentic AI**, built as part of the [Panaverse DAO](https://www.panaverse.co/) and other personal explorations.

Each project is designed to demonstrate real-world applications of autonomous agents, LLM integration, decision-making loops, and environment interaction using modern AI tooling.
